# Sentiment Analysis of Restaurant Reviews

## Problem Statement:
It is highly competitive for a business to thrive in the Restaurant Industry. Understanding the customer satisfaction is one of the crucial aspects for the success. Analyzing the customer reviews manually can be time-consuming given the large number of customers. This project aims at analyzing the huge volumes of customer reviews to understand customer satisfaction levels, extract meaningful insights and identify the areas for improvement.

## Business Objective:
Usage of machine learning techniques to analyze the restaurant reviews and predict the sentiment polarity. This analysis will benefit the restaurants gain valuable insights about customer satisfaction levels and make informed decisions to enhance the customer experience.

## Dataset Description:
The project utilizes a static dataset containing restaurant reviews sourced from Kaggle platform. The proposed dataset includes the attributes "restaurant name", "reviewer", "review", "rating", and reviewer-specific metadata such as "number of reviews" and the "number of followers".

## Solution to the Problem:
The solution to this problem involves the usage of Python with Pandas DataFrame functions combined with NLP techniques for preprocessing and analyzing the restaurant review dataset. The key aspect of this solution is to employ the Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural networks for sentiment analysis.

## Why LSTM for Sentiment Analysis:
LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is capable of capturing the dependencies in the sequential data. Its ability to preserve the information over sequences makes it an ideal choice for sentiment analysis tasks where the contextual information plays a crucial role in determining the sentiment.

## Technologies Used:
Python, Pandas, Natural Language Processing, Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) Neural Networks.
